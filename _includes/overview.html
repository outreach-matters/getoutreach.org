                                Outreach campaigns allow you to inform your community members and followers of your community themes about past and upcoming events. Recipients can boost your PR by invoking their own channels where they match the ones specified in the campaign. The Outreach service lowers the barrier to participation by automating much of the manual labour involved. The community give give feedback and help fine-tune strategy and objectives before a campaign is launched.

                                Campaigns revolve around themes. They are central to your community, and are what attracts people to become active for your cause. There can be a single theme. For an open-source developer it may be their project, to attract funding. But for Greenpeace there'll be many, like 'Climate change' and 'Sustainability'. Once defined people can subscribe and follow them to receive campaign-related activities, such as newly launched campaigns and their final outcomes.

                                Campaign events are what is being promoted. Events can be any occurrence, online or in the real world, that is related to a campaign theme. They may occur in the future or have already passed. Some examples are a conference, a blog post, an upcoming software release, a funding request or actions of others that need a response. For each event a set of objectives, appropriate channels and desired actions may be specified so that the campaign follows a strategic plan.

                                PR channels are chosen based on themes, objectives and events of the campaign. For a software release these could be just Hacker News, Techcrunch and some forums, while Extinction Rebellion may target all major social media. A community member becomes a campaigner when they perform actions on a channel according to campaign guidelines. This participation is entirely voluntary and for ethical reasons no pressure or monetary incentives must be at play.

                                Activism is easier when it takes little effort. Outreach makes campaigning as convenient as possible by automating many actions relevant to a particular channel and part of the campaign. For Twitter a single-click consent might trigger multiple Likes and Retweets of an event, from the personal account of the campaigner. Campaigners remain in full control. After all real activists should only act from conviction, unforced. Act from the heart and mind.
